excerpt: "First family trip to LA, Pokemon content creation, and adapting to a crawling baby"

Ok these are progressively getting worse and worse timing wise but it's for good reason! I got slammed with a monster project at work and had to go to LA last week. It's the first big trip as a family and HayHay's first plane ride. Definitely the scariest thing as a new parent I have done so far, but was worth it to see him meet Tigger and visit Disneyland.

It's been awesome getting to talk to more students over the past few weeks and I have started putting together a guide on some portfolio feedback. I am still working on it, so look forward to that soon.

Aside from work shenanigans it's been fun posting more Pokemon content and seeing how different platforms work. TikTok vs Insta vs Youtube is pretty wild, and has made me appreciate all the content I watch a lot more.

Now it's getting closer to springtime I am hoping to go out running more and being outside. Hayden has started crawling which is now causing a lot of rethinking design decisions in the house in the name of baby safety LOL. It's gonna be a wild time!!!
