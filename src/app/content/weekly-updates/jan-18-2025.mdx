excerpt: "Reflections on overcoming anxiety, taking risks, and embracing imperfect work"
---

A bit more somber of a week start due to a tragic Ravens self-implosion Sunday Night... but what can you do, that's football.

I've been thinking a lot about barriers to getting started on things, and how I can take more risks to get more out of my life. As a very anxiety-driven person, putting myself out there has always been a challenge. (Flashbacks to having a 48-hour panic attack before dropping my public speaking class.) I think especially as a creative person, I am always paralyzed with the feeling of putting out work I'm not proud of. But this year, I want to focus more on putting out work no matter the quality, and getting feedback as often as possible.

To that end, I have been trying more to distill down my thoughts on various topics, and hopefully by next week, I'll have more concrete thoughts to share.
