excerpt: "Exploring side projects, from Figma plugins to Pokemon cards, and finding joy in creation"

I've been diving into several exciting side projects lately, and while I've been a bit less focused on my usual routine, the creative energy has been incredible. Sure, like most side projects, they might not turn into anything massive, but there's something special about exploring something new each day.

## Librarian
I'm developing a Figma plugin that digs deeper into library files, analyzing variables more thoroughly than Figma's native capabilities. It's a neat little tool that fills a specific need I've noticed.

## Pokemon x Design Channel
This one's particularly exciting! I've made opening Pokemon cards my daily reward for reading and writing. After an amazing FaceTime session with Ryan where we both pulled chase cards (including a 151 Charizard!), I realized there might be something here. I'm envisioning content that blends Pokemon with design, wrapped in cozy, cinematic vibes to stand out from typical Pokemon content. Reading Aaron Draplin's book this morning really fired me up about creating things just for the pure joy of it.

## Landscaping Adventures
With the interior of our house finally feeling right, we're turning our attention outdoors. I'm particularly stoked about creating dedicated spaces for grilling and outdoor cooking. It's going to be a whole new canvas to work with.

## Coding Renaissance
I've rekindled my relationship with coding through Cursor. While this site runs on traditional HTML and CSS, I'm exploring React/Vite/NextJS for more robust work projects. There's something satisfying about building smaller, focused projects.

## Paul x Ben JV
This collaboration with Paul on office space consulting has been incredibly fulfilling. Reconnecting with old coworkers and tackling problems we're passionate about brings back that spark of working with friends. It's still small-scale, but that's exactly what makes it special.

Writing this out has been eye-opening. While I might have too many irons in the fire, each project brings its own kind of joy. It might not all be conventionally impressive or marketable, but it makes me happy, and that's what truly matters. I'm grateful for each of these opportunities to create and explore.
