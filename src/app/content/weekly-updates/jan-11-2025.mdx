This week, my heart goes out to everyone in LA dealing with the fires. It's so tough to see families losing their homes. If you're able to, consider donating to one of the many organizations providing relief.

This week, I've been completely obsessed with Pokémon cards. It started very innocently a few months ago with Pokémon Pocket, and I've been slowly getting deeper in the weeds ever since. Lately, I've been falling down the YouTube rabbit hole watching [Deep Pocket Monster](https://www.youtube.com/c/DeepPocketMonster), [PokeChloe](https://www.youtube.com/@PokiChloe), [PokeDean](https://www.youtube.com/@PokeDean) and [Coops Collection](https://www.youtube.com/@CoopsCollection). After hours (and hours) of videos, I finally caved and bought some packs myself.

To make it a little more productive & after feeling inspired from my other post, I'm using the packs as motivation. If I exercise, write, and read for 30 minutes a day, I get to open one. So far, it's been working pretty well (though I should probably be more worried about my YouTube watch hours than the cards).

Honestly, I always thought the Pokémon card world was all about flipping for profit, but seeing these videos really changed my perspective. Watching Deep Pocket Monster especially, you see how people come together to help each other. Complete strangers donating cards, trading for missing pieces, or just cheering on Pat. Hands down the highlight of these videos are the kids. They're so kind and patient, and it's truly inspiring to see. To see how excited they get by being able to help out, its so heartwarming, it makes me excited to share a hobby like this with my son someday.

On the personal side, this week has been my first back at work after paternity leave. It's definitely an adjustment, but so far, so good. I'm looking forward to seeing what this year has in store.
