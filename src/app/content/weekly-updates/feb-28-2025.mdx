So I totally dropped the ball and forgot to post earlier this week. Oops! But hey, better late than never, right?

This week has actually been pretty great. Kicked things off with a cool work project that's getting some nice momentum, which feels awesome.

Mid-week I headed into the city to speak at this Figma Event. It's been forever since I've been around that many people, and I'm not gonna lie - seeing that line outside freaked me out a bit. Took a walk around the block to calm down and **LITERALLY RAN INTO DANIEL RICCIARDO**. Still can't believe it! It was just a split second, but seeing one of my favorite athletes somehow zapped away all my nerves about speaking.

The event itself was a blur of good vibes. Got to catch up with old coworkers and friends I've been missing way too much lately. Definitely need to make more effort to see these people!

My talk went fine - fumbled a couple times but got my points across okay. Afterward was just a mad rush of questions. Sorry if you were there and I seemed frazzled while answering you! It was a bit much, but in a good way. Really cool seeing so many students and young designers so pumped about the industry.

My secret weapon? Brought Pokémon cards! Sharing what I love always helps me feel comfortable, and what started as my personal security blanket turned into a whole card-trading frenzy. Definitely doing that again!

Overall, a pretty awesome week of pushing my boundaries. Got some new project ideas brewing that I'm excited about. Thinking I'll start adding a project status section to these weekly posts too.
