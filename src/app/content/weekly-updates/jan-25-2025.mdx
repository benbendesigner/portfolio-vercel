excerpt: "Reflections on workplace culture, personal growth, and setting goals for 2025"
---

Over the past few years, I've found myself increasingly disconnected from the work I once loved, trapped in a system where reorgs, layoffs, and political maneuvering have replaced genuine collaboration.

The workplace culture has shifted dramatically. Instead of focusing on customer problems, teams now optimize for stakeholder visibility. Everyone's walking on eggshells, constantly worried about job security. This environment has fundamentally changed how people interact. It's become a "me before us" mentality that erodes trust and motivation.

I've realized I'm becoming someone I don't recognize. The excitement I once felt about design and work has been slowly replaced by cynicism and uncertainty. When I recently reviewed my portfolio, I was struck by how much better I used to be and how much more passionate and engaged I was with my craft.

### My Plan: Focus on What I Can Control
- Work on projects I'm genuinely proud of
- Positively impact team culture
- Continue personal projects
- Pursue personal growth (and yes, collect more Pokemon cards)

### My Goals for 2025
- Build out my website weekly
- Create a book library
- Develop a project showcase
- Write daily
- Read daily
- Build something meaningful
- Travel with family
- Reconnect with friends
