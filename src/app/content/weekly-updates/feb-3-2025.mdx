excerpt: "Reflections on revisiting my childhood home, gratitude, and creating new memories"
---

Revisiting my childhood home after 7 years brought unexpected clarity. While driving familiar streets lined with weathered barns and freshly painted houses, memories flooded back. Yet the experience felt different from what I'd imagined.

Instead of sadness, I felt gratitude. The visit reminded me why I'd wanted to leave - to pursue something beyond my small town comfort zone. Looking back, I appreciate how that desire led me to San Francisco, international travels, and months in Korea.

Being there with Hayden and Minji highlighted how far I've come from dreaming beyond that front yard. Now I'm excited to create a home where Hayden can build his own memories while nurturing the same curiosity to explore.

Reconnecting with friends was valuable too - a reminder to reach out beyond my daily bubble.

It's been an emotional week, and I'm looking forward to gaining work clarity soon, with some promising developments ahead.
