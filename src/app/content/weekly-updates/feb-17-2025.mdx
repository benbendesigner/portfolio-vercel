excerpt: "First steps into content creation and finding balance between work and creative projects"
---

This week has been a back and forth between work and my creative projects. I took a big step and published my first few short videos on YouTube and TikTok. It's been exciting watching the engagement grow - my first video gained traction after about a day on both platforms. Though interestingly, my follow-up videos have been pretty quiet. I've started analyzing posting times and content types to understand what works best on each platform. It's become its own engaging puzzle to solve.

Outside of that, I've been switching between coding projects and new design vision sprints at work. While all the RTO discussions and business changes have made focusing a bit challenging, I've found that balancing work with my creative hobbies has helped ease the pressure I used to put on myself. That constant feeling of not doing enough has finally started to lift.
